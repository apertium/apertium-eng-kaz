1	WHERE IS JAMES?
2	[SN James] and [SN Mary] are [AdvP in the garden]. [SN The weather] is nice today, it is very warm. But yesterday it was very cold! They could not play outside then. [SN James] and [SN Mary] love to play, they always play together [AdvP in the garden] [AdvP in front of the big house].
3	[SN James] is [SN a little boy] and he is [SN six years old]. [SN The little girl] is [SN his sister], she is [SN five years old]. [SN James] has [SN a small dog], [SN the dog] is also [AdvP in the garden] now. [SN The dog] likes to play [AdvP with the two children]. [SN The dog] is very happy now.
4	Does [SN Mary] also have [SN a dog]? No, [SN Mary] does not have [SN a dog], she has [SN a cat]. But [SN the cat] is [AdvP in the house], [SN the cat] is sleeping.
5	[SN Their mother] is [AdvP inside the house] [AdvP with the cat], she looks [AdvP through the window] and sees [SN James] and [SN Mary] playing. [SN James] quickly runs [AdvP to a big old tree], he is hiding [AdvP from [SN Mary]]. Do you know why? [SN Mary] is sitting and has [SN her hands] [AdvP in front of her eyes]. She can't see anything and she is counting. Why does she do that? And what is [SN James] doing [AdvP near the tree]?
6	It is [SN a game]. When [SN Mary] has finished counting she looks around. She is searching for [SN James]: where did he go? Did you see him?
7	[SN Mary] does not know where [SN James] is. She asks [SN the dog]: "Did you see [SN James]?". But [SN the dog] can not speak of course! So [SN Mary] gets [SN no answer] [AdvP to her question]. People never get [SN an answer] when they speak [AdvP to dogs]!
8	[SN Mary] looks [AdvP at her mother] [AdvP behind the window], her mother is laughing. [SN Mary] thinks that she has seen where [SN James] went: "Tell me where he is!", she says [AdvP to her mother]. "No [SN Mary], I can't tell you!", she replies. Although she probably knows where he is, she does not want to tell.
9	[SN Mary] slowly walks [AdvP through the garden]. She is still trying to find [SN James]. She looks [AdvP under the table] and [AdvP under the chairs], but [SN James] is not there. She looks everywhere but she can not find [SN James].
10	Then she hears [SN a sound], it is coming [AdvP from behind the big old tree]. Could that be [SN James]? There is [SN the sound again]! She listens carefully. It is not [SN a bird] or [SN another animal]. She can hear it well now. It must be [SN James]!
11	Then she also sees [SN a little hand] and when she walks closer she also sees [SN his head]! She laughs and says: "I found you!". They are both happy and go [AdvP to the house], it is time to eat something and drink some water!
